Description: Matrices of Implied Causation (MICs) are a tool for 
    understanding a path modelâ€™s implications for the causal influence of one 
    variable on another, and for comparing models on that basis. While causality
    cannot be determined simply by fitting a path model, researchers often use 
    these models as a representation of an underlying causal process model.  In
    these cases, MICs and MIC tables are useful for comparing models for face 
    validity, and for the design of optimal experiments to differentiate the
    predictions they make.
