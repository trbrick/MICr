## What is this?

The MICr package provides the ability to compute and display Matrices of
Implied Causation (MICs) and the corresponding MIC Tables for Structural
Equation Models (SEMs).

MICs provide an at-a-glance way to examine the causal implications of a
model. The MIC and MIC Table display the total effects, adding up all
mediated and direct effects, of every variable on every other variable
in the model. We argue that model-implied causal structures should be
examined as a means of model checking, and that MIC comparisons should
be used as part of model comparison and utilized as a form of
intervention design.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of MICr with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trbrick/MICr")
```
